# Event Guest List Manager 🎉

This project is a simple web application that lets users manage a guest list for an event. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows adding, removing, and updating guest details directly in the browser without page reloads.

## 🚀 Features

- Add a guest by submitting their name through a form.
- Display guests dynamically on the page.
- Remove guests using a "Remove" button.
- Limit guest list to 10 people (with alert if exceeded).
- Toggle each guest's RSVP status: **Attending / Not Attending**.

### 🌟 Stretch Features

- Categorize guests as **Friend**, **Family**, or **Colleague** (with color tags).
- Display the **timestamp** of when each guest was added.
- Edit guest names.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Use `event.preventDefault()` to stop default form actions
- Capture and handle user input
- Dynamically update the web page without refreshing

## 💡 Purpose

This project was built to practice **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and building a fully interactive user experience from scratch. The challenge was to create a form-driven app that responds instantly to user input — without refreshing the page.
